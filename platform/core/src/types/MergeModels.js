         * Utility function for merging domain object models (or any
         * JavaScript object which follows the same conventions.)
         * Performs a "deep merge", resolving conflicts (occurrences
         * of the same property in both objects) such that:
         *
         * * Non-conflicting properties are both contained in the
         *   result object.
         * * Conflicting properties which are both arrays are
         *   concatenated.
         * * Conflicting properties which are both objects are
         *   merged recursively.
         * * Conflicting properties which do not fall into any of the
         *   preceding categories are taken from the second argument,
         *   shadowing any values from the first.
         *
         * An optional third argument, the "merger", may be provided.
         * This may be either a function, or an object containing
         * key-value pairs where keys are strings (corresponding to
         * the names of properties) and values are other mergers
         * (either functions or objects.)
         *
         * * If the merger is a function, it will be used upon the
         *   two input objects in lieu of the behavior described
         *   above.
         * * If the merger is an object, then its values will be
         *   used as mergers when resolving properties with
         *   corresponding keys in the recursive step.
         *
         *
         * @param a the first object to be merged
         * @param b the second object to be merged
         * @param merger the merger, as described above
         * @returns {*} the result of merging `a` and `b`
