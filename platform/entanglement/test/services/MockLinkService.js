         * MockLinkService provides the same interface as the linkService,
         * returning promises where it would normally do so.  At it's core,
         * it is a jasmine spy object, but it also tracks the promises it
         * returns and provides shortcut methods for resolving those promises
         * synchronously.
         *
         * Usage:
         *
         * ```javascript
         * var linkService = new MockLinkService();
         *
         * // validate is a standard jasmine spy.
         * linkService.validate.and.returnValue(true);
         * var isValid = linkService.validate(object, parentObject);
         * expect(isValid).toBe(true);
         *
         * // perform returns promises and tracks them.
         * var whenLinked = jasmine.createSpy('whenLinked');
         * linkService.perform(object, parentObject).then(whenLinked);
         * expect(whenLinked).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
         * linkService.perform.calls.mostRecent().promise.resolve('someArg');
         * expect(whenLinked).toHaveBeenCalledWith('someArg');
         * ```
