         * Handles drag interactions on frames in layouts. This will
         * provides new positions/dimensions for frames based on
         * relative pixel positions provided; these will take into account
         * the grid size (in a snap-to sense) and will enforce some minimums
         * on both position and dimensions.
         *
         * The provided position and dimensions factors will determine
         * whether this is a move or a resize, and what type of resize it
         * will be. For instance, a position factor of [1, 1]
         * will move a frame along with the mouse as the drag
         * proceeds, while a dimension factor of [0, 0] will leave
         * dimensions unchanged. Combining these in different
         * ways results in different handles; a position factor of
         * [1, 0] and a dimensions factor of [-1, 0] will implement
         * a left-edge resize, as the horizontal position will move
         * with the mouse while the horizontal dimensions shrink in
         * kind (and vertical properties remain unmodified.)
