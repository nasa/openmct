            // * Maintain a queue as an array of objects containing key-value
            //   pairs. Putting values into the queue will assign to the 
            //   earliest-available queue position for the associated key 
            //   (appending to the array if necessary.)
            // * Maintain a set of counts for each key, such that determining
            //   the next available queue position is easy; O(1) insertion.
            // * When retrieving objects, pop off the queue and decrement 
            //   counts. This provides O(n+k) or O(k) retrieval for a queue
            //   of length n with k unique keys; this depends on whether
            //   the browser's implementation of Array.prototype.shift is
            //   O(n) or O(1).

            // if we have a queue that looks like:
