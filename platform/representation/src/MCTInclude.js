         * Defines the mct-include directive. This acts like the
         * ng-include directive, except it accepts a symbolic
         * key which can be exposed by bundles, instead of requiring
         * an explicit path.
         *
         * This directive uses two-way binding for three attributes:
         *
         * * `key`, matched against the key of a defined template extension
         *   in order to determine which actual template to include.
         * * `ng-model`, populated as `ngModel` in the loaded template's
         *   scope; used for normal ng-model purposes (e.g. if the
         *   included template is meant to two-way bind to a data model.)
         * * `parameters`, used to communicate display parameters to
         *   the included template (e.g. title.) The difference between
         *   `parameters` and `ngModel` is intent: Both are two-way
         *   bound, but `ngModel` is useful for data models (more like
         *   an output) and `parameters` is meant to be useful for
         *   display parameterization (more like an input.)
         *

         * @constructor
         * @param {TemplateDefinition[]} templates an array of
         *        template extensions
