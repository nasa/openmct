         * The `mct-device` directive, when applied as an attribute,
         * only includes the element when the device being used matches
         * a set of characteristics required.
         *
         * Required characteristics are given as space-separated strings
         * as the value to this attribute, e.g.:
         *
         *    <span mct-device="mobile portrait">Hello world!</span>
         *
         * ...will only show Hello world! when viewed on a mobile device
         * in the portrait orientation.
         *
         * Valid device characteristics to detect are:
         *
         * * `mobile`: Phones or tablets.
         * * `phone`: Phones specifically.
         * * `tablet`: Tablets specifically.
         * * `desktop`: Non-mobile devices.
         * * `portrait`: Devices in a portrait-style orientation.
         * * `landscape`: Devices in a landscape-style orientation.
         * * `touch`: Device supports touch events.
         *
         * @param {AgentService} agentService used to detect device type
         *        based on information about the user agent
