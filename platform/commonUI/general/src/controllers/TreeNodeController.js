         * The TreeNodeController supports the tree node representation;
         * a tree node has a label for the current object as well as a
         * subtree which shows (and is not loaded until) the node is
         * expanded.
         *
         * This controller tracks the following, so that the tree node
         * template may update its state accordingly:
         *
         * * Whether or not the tree node has ever been expanded (this
         *   is used to lazily load, exactly once, the subtree)
         * * Whether or not the node is currently the domain object
         *   of navigation (this gets highlighted differently to
         *   provide the user with visual feedback.)
         *
         * Additionally, this controller will automatically trigger
         * node expansion when this tree node's _subtree_ will contain
         * the navigated object (recursively, this becomes an
         * expand-to-show-navigated-object behavior.)
         *
         * Finally, if a `callback` property is passed in through the
         * `parameters` attribute of the `tree-node`, that callback
         * will be invoked whenever a user clicks in a manner which
         * would result in a selection. This callback is invoked
         * even if the selection does not change (if you are only
         * interested in changes, watch the `selectedObject` property
         * of the object passed in `ng-model` instead.)
         *
