         * The mct-drag directive allows drag functionality
         * (in the mousedown-mousemove-mouseup sense, as opposed to
         * the drag-and-drop sense) to be attached to specific
         * elements. This takes the form of three attributes:
         *
         * * `mct-drag`: An Angular expression to evaluate during
         *   drag movement.
         * * `mct-drag-down`: An Angular expression to evaluate
         *   when the drag begins.
         * * `mct-drag-up`: An Angular expression to evaluate when
         *   dragging ends.
         *
         * In each case, a variable `delta` will be provided to the
         * expression; this is a two-element array or the horizontal
         * and vertical pixel offset of the current mouse position
         * relative to the mouse position where dragging began.
         *
