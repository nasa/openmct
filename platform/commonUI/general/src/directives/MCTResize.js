         * The mct-resize directive allows the size of a displayed
         * HTML element to be tracked. This is done by polling,
         * since the DOM API does not currently provide suitable
         * events to watch this reliably.
         *
         * Attributes related to this directive are interpreted as
         * follows:
         *
         * * `mct-resize`: An Angular expression to evaluate when
         *   the size changes; the variable `bounds` will be provided
         *   with two fields, `width` and `height`, both in pixels.
         * * `mct-resize-interval`: Optional; the interval, in milliseconds,
         *   at which to watch for updates. In some cases checking for
         *   resize can carry a cost (it forces recalculation of
         *   positions within the document) so it may be preferable to watch
         *   infrequently. If omitted, a default of 100ms will be used.
         *   This is an Angular expression, and it will be re-evaluated after
         *   each interval.
         *
