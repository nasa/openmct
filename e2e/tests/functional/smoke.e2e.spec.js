/*
This test suite is dedicated to tests which can quickly verify that any openmct installation is
operable and that any type of testing can proceed.

Ideally, smoke tests should make zero assumptions about how and where they are run. This makes them
more resilient to change and therefor a better indicator of failure. Smoke tests will also run quickly
as they cover a very "thin surface" of functionality.

When deciding between authoring new smoke tests or functional tests, ask yourself "would I feel
comfortable running this test during a live mission?" Avoid creating or deleting Domain Objects.
Make no assumptions about the order that elements appear in the DOM.
